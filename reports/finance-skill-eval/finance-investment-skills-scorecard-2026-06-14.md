# Finance / Investment Skills Scorecard

Date: 2026-06-14

This report consolidates the existing finance-skill evaluation artifacts in `reports/finance-skill-eval/` with a fresh static review of the repository's finance and investment-related `SKILL.md` files.

## Scope

Included:

- Investment research, market data, stock/ETF/options analysis, macro, portfolio/risk, backtesting, trading plans, monitoring, valuation, equity research, private equity, wealth management, and investment banking workflows.

Excluded from the recommended standard suite, but still noted:

- Fund administration and KYC/operations skills: finance-adjacent but not investment decision workflows.
- Generic spreadsheet/PPT/document authoring skills: useful infrastructure, but not finance-investment skills by themselves.
- General social/media/content skills unless explicitly finance-market oriented.

## Scoring Rubric

10-point score, normalized to 100 in tables:

- Executability: scripts, commands, data contract, clear input/output.
- Investment value: usefulness in real investor workflow.
- Scope clarity: trigger, boundaries, and fallback behavior.
- Non-overlap: whether it contributes a unique function versus nearby skills.
- Maintenance risk: external keys, unstable scraping, model/platform dependencies, stale references.

Score interpretation:

- 90-100: Standard-suite core.
- 80-89: Strong, core or near-core.
- 70-79: Useful, often optional or category-specific.
- 60-69: Keep as backup/template/lab item.
- Below 60: Do not recommend for standard suite without rewrite or dependency fix.

## Data And Infrastructure

| Skill | Score | Verdict | Reason |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `tushare-openclaw-skill` | 95 | Core | Best structured China-market data spine; native Tushare coverage for A-shares, funds, futures, bonds, fundamentals, valuation, dividends, unlocks, and macro. Requires `TUSHARE_TOKEN`, acceptable as a finance data key. |
| `a-stock-data` | 88 | Core A-share multi-source layer | Very broad A-share coverage including quotes, research reports, themes, northbound, Dragon-Tiger, unlocks, margin, block trades, holders, dividends, news, announcements. Complements Tushare by covering real-time, theme, capital-flow, announcement, and no-key direct-source workflows. |
| `llmquant-data` | 86 | Institutional-data core if LLMQuant is available | Clean router for SEC filings, 13F holders, macro snapshots, and grounded macro briefs. Strong data contract, but gated by LLMQuant data/MCP availability. |
| `yfinance-data` | 78 | Core lightweight global data | Good no-key US/global fallback for prices, statements, options, dividends, earnings, holders. Yahoo rate limits mean it should not be the only data source. |
| `akshare-stock` | 76 | A-share fallback | Useful AkShare wrapper with scripts, but overlaps heavily with Tushare and `a-stock-data`; weaker guardrails. |
| `stock_datasource` | 72 | Platform adapter | Useful local project adapter for a stock data platform and subskills; better for deployment/plumbing than day-to-day investment analysis. |
| `stock_datasource/skills/stock-mcp-query` | 72 | Data-service support | Clear MCP query path for historical data and statements; recommended only when that local MCP service is part of the stack. |
| `stock_datasource/skills/stock-rt-subscribe` | 70 | Real-time-data support | WebSocket subscription support is valuable for live monitoring, but operationally narrower than standard analysis workflows. |
| `openclaw-stock-data-skill` | 70 | Backup | Has a specific `data.diemeng.chat` API contract; useful if that API is provisioned, otherwise less standard than Tushare. |
| `tushare-plugin-builder` | 68 | Developer/lab | Good for extending the data platform with new Tushare endpoints; not an investor-facing standard skill. |
| `funda-data` | 66 | Institutional backup | Useful where Funda MCP is configured, but mixed MCP/API dependency makes it less portable than `llmquant-data` or `yfinance-data`. |

## Market, Macro, News, And Events

| Skill | Score | Verdict | Reason |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `policy-monitor` | 88 | Core for China policy-driven markets | Strong direct policy/regulatory monitoring role; fills a gap not covered by price/fundamental data. |
| `llmquant-macro` | 84 | Core if LLMQuant is available | Strong router for macro dashboards, central bank previews, inflation/growth/liquidity, and portfolio impact. |
| `llmquant-market-intelligence` | 84 | Core if LLMQuant is available | Clean market sentiment and event-probability routing; good high-level intelligence layer. |
| `llmquant-events` | 84 | Core if LLMQuant is available | Better event abstraction than many single-purpose earnings/event skills. |
| `macro-regime-detector` | 82 | Core/optional | Useful 1-2 year regime framework with scripts and explicit components; data dependencies apply. |
| `market-environment-analysis` | 78 | Optional | Good broad market briefing workflow with no key, but mostly web-search/reporting guidance rather than a strong executable data pipeline. |
| `alphaear-news` | 77 | Optional news layer | Useful finance-news/trend/prediction-market fetcher with scripts; overlaps with LLMQuant market intelligence. |
| `economic-calendar-fetcher` | 76 | Optional | Valuable calendar function but narrower; can be folded under `llmquant-events` in a standard suite. |
| `market-news-analyst` | 66 | Backup | Good analytical framing, but browser/manual dependence reduces standard-suite fit. |
| `finance-sentiment` | 66 | Backup | Useful sentiment layer, but overlaps with AlphaEar/LLMQuant and depends on external data/model choices. |
| `hormuz-strait` | 62 | Event-specific | Good for one geopolitical theme, too narrow for standard suite. |

| `estimate-analysis` | 68 | Optional | Useful estimate-data framing; overlaps with earnings and valuation skills. |
| `earnings-preview` | 67 | Optional | Useful yfinance-based pre-earnings structure; narrower than `llmquant-events` plus `earnings-trade-analyzer`. |
