# Task Plan: Skill Origin, Index, Scoring, and README Upgrade

## Goal
Upgrade the repository from copied installer-source metadata to a maintainable enriched registry that supports native upstream URLs, horizontal tiers, vertical categories, dependency labels, scoring, monthly review, and a non-duplicated standard bundle.

## Phases

| Phase | Status | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Audit current metadata shape | complete | Current catalog gaps and script inputs identified |
| 2. Define enriched catalog schema | complete | Machine-readable schema and generated enriched catalog |
| 3. Generate indexes and README sections | complete | Tier/type/dependency/standard bundle Markdown generated |
| 4. Update monthly automation docs | complete | GitHub Action and update SOP changed to monthly review |
| 5. Run verification checks | complete | JSON validity, generator output, audit command results |

## Decisions
- Treat existing installer URLs as mirror sources, not native origins.
- Preserve existing skill files; add metadata/index generation rather than editing hundreds of skill directories manually.
- Use deterministic heuristic classification as a first pass, with explicit `origin_confidence` and `needs_origin_review` flags.
- Exclude Open/Hermes preset skills from the standard install bundle via a preset exclusion list.

## Errors Encountered
